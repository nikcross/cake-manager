Changes List - as requested as part of this test


As requested, made an initial change to the existing project as it was not serving the index.jsp page.

This required the web.xml file to be changed, adding the required xml attributes to the web-app tag, setting the version correctly. This was committed to a bug branch then merged into the master branch once the fix was seen to work.


To redevelop the project in a modern way, it was decided to separate the underlying services to list cakes and add cakes into a separate server, implementing the two functions as restful endpoints and redevelop the human interface as a web client in a separate project.


The services were redeveloped using SpringBoot with the system further separated into service, controller and domain layers.


Lombok was introduced to reduce the amount of boilerplate code required.


An initial integration test was created to test that the restful endpoints behaved as expected.


Vuejs was chosen for the web client framework, running in as a nodejs based server.


The web client was separated into two main elements, a main application and a cake submission form.


The two projects are available on github with instructions on running in the readme file of cake-manager
